SparkFun Electronics Quality Control PCB Panels
=======

This repo contains eagle files that are the "panelization" of many testbed PCB designs. They are essentially eagle board files that are 10" by 15". Much like how Batch PCB used to create a panel of multiple designs, we will collect testbed PCBs as they are needed and "add" them to the latest panel.

The latest panel lives in the root directory of this repo. 

Once a panel is ordered by the QC Manager (me, Pete Lewis), the file will be moved to the "ORDERED" folder. I will also add the Purchase Order number to the name of the file.

When you have a new design you'd like to be ordered. Please pull this repo, add in your design to the latest panel file, then commit with a message stating what design you have added. If your design filled up the panel, please also add a note in your commit stating "PANEL FULL"
